PART 3:
a and b) Number of Nodes Generated // Number of Duplicate Nodes
To test the number of nodes generated, in both the minimax search and the alpha-beta search, I created a hash table that checked for whether or not the node had been seen already - if not, then it adds the node with a val of 1, if yes, then it updates the counter of that hashed node by 1. 

For regular minimax at depth 4:
TIME 1: 34898 unique, duplicate 185699
TIME 2: 107930 unique, 66637 dup
TIME 3: 41429 unique, 278473 dup
TIME 4: 39859 unique, 191902 dup
TIME 5: 20667 unique, 122945 dup
TIME 6: 14874 unique, 79327 dup
TIME 7: 53335 unique, 285664 dup
TIME 8: 23229 unique, 95945 dup
TIME 9: 18719 unique, 93517 dup
TIME 10: 35640 unique, 236147 dup

Alpha beta used the following code twice within the alpha beta algorithm
once in each side of the color if/else checking statement, whereas the code was
used only once to do the minimax checking:
l = [b.get_squares(color), b.get_squares(-color)]
tup = tuple(tuple(i) for i in l)
if self.node_gen.has_key(tup):
    self.node_gen[tup] = self.node_gen[tup] + 1
else:
    self.node_gen[tup] = 1


and then used the following to print it out after doing alpha beta/minimax


print len(self.node_gen.keys()) #number of nodes
for x in self.node_gen:
    if self.node_gen[x] > 1:
        nodes_revisited = nodes_revisited + self.node_gen[x] - 1
print nodes_revisited #number of revisited

where the self.node_gen was a dictionary that I created during the __init__

For the alpha beta search at depth 5, the following values were found in 10 runs:
TIME 1: 137290 unique nodes, 40414 revisited
TIME 2: 93793 unique nodes, 31261 revisited
TIME 3: 126401 unique nodes, 52962 revisited
TIME 4: 108731 unique nodes, 37744 revisited
TIME 5: 145577 unique nodes, 27836 revisited
TIME 6: 157985 unique nodes, 26446 revisited
TIME 7: 109354 unique nodes, 14996 revisited
TIME 8: 204762 unique nodes, 44915 revisited
TIME 9: 188098 unique nodes, 39882 revisited
TIME 10: 194231 unique nodes, 32211 revisited

c) Average Branching Factor
The average branching factor is the number of possible legal moves at each turn. I found the average branching factor to be 10.5 when I ran the program, although 
I looked it up online and I believe the avg branching factor of Othello should really be 10… Close enough I guess?
Anyway, this is the code that I used to figure this out:
In __init__, I created an array called self.branch_factor, which I later used 
in get_move right before doing alpha beta/minimax each turn by using the code
moves = board.get_legal_moves(color)
self.branch_factor.append(len(moves))


And then later you can see the array of all of the different branch factors by
print self.branch_factor
Then I took all of these values and averaged them using a calculator. 

BUT THEN - I saw on piazza that you wanted it done for every node created -
used the same code, but just put it so that it was when looking at the
possible moves of the possible boards within the algorithms themselves.
Anyway, the avg branching factor here came out to 10.2 in one run

d) Runtime of Algorithms
Below are the avg of 10 games for each depth, which I got by looking at how much
time was left over after a game ended and after each move and then average
time a full game took after the 10 games and the time each move took. First listed is for the whole game,
second is for one iteration of get_move
MINIMAX:
depth 1 - 0 seconds (almost instant calculation every time), 0 sec avg move
depth 2 - .6 seconds, .02 sec avg move
depth 3 - 4.1 seconds, .14 sec avg move
depth 4 - 51.2 seconds, 1.72 sec avg move
depth 5 - took forever x 10, ugh. 542.2 seconds, 18.7 sec avg move
By the time I got to depth 6 it took far too long to run -  I waited over a 
half hour twice and then gave up because it had only made it to round 6 the first
try and round 7 the second time I tried it 

ALPHA-BETA:
depth 1 - 0 seconds (almost instant calculation every time), 0 sec avg move
depth 2 - .1 seconds, .003 sec avg 
depth 3 - 3.2 seconds, .12 sec avg
depth 4 - 12.8 seconds, .43 sec avg
depth 5 - 54.7 seconds (this is if I don’t put in the condition that if 
it gets too close to 60 s to just pick a random move, which I ended up 
adding because every now and then it is over 60 s), 1.83 sec avg
depth 6 - 336.4 seconds, 11.2 sec avg

As you can see, at the beginning the difference in speeds isn’t really all too much, but as you get to deeper and deeper depths, the difference in runtimes
becomes incredibly pronounced - alpha-beta ends up with a much shorter runtime 
whereas it becomes a huge chore to even run the minimax.
