HW 1 - Random Sentence Generator

Part 1: 
I added non-terminal symbols, used this way:
-Adjective (to describe singular nouns) ie "The fat man ran fast" where "fat"
is the adjective
-AdjectivePlur (to describe plural nouns) ie "I saw him on several
occasions" where "several" is a plural adjective
-Adverb (to modify verbs) ie "I did not go" where "not" modifies did
-ArticleS (singular articles that help to make a noun specified) ie "The dog
ran" where "the" is the singular article
-AuxVerbPres (to be the auxillary to another verb) ie "She must go there"
where "must" is the auxillary present-tense verb
-ConjunctionCoord and ConjunctionSub (linking words, phrases) ie "I like tea and
coffee" where "and" is a coordinating conjunction or "Whether she goes is a
mystery" where "whether" is a subordinate conjunction
-PluralPresHelpVerb and PluralPastHelpVerb (helping verbs work with main
verb to describe action) ie "They were chasing dogs" where "were" is a
plural past help verb or "They are chasing dogs" where "are" is a present
plural help verb
-PronounExpletive and PronounReflexive (reflexive to refer to subject of
sentence, expletive as a "dummy" pronoun that is just syntactically
required) ie "It is raining" where "it is an expletive pronoun or "John
doesn't trust himself" where "himself is a reflexive pronoun
-PluralNoun and SingularNoun (as opposed to just having a noun because there
are times when we needed to talk about multiples) ie "I like dogs" where
"dogs" is a plural noun vs "I like the dog" where "dog" is a singular noun
-Premod (to premodify a preposition) ie "There were many people such as
Jessica and Adam" where "such" premodifies the preposition "as"
-Preposition (to express spatial relationships, to form phrases to modify
other parts of speech) ie "He was in the bedroom" where "in" is a
preposition
-RelativePronoun (to mark a relative clause) ie "The guy that you saw
yesterday was Jack" where "that" is the relative pronoun and the relative
clause would be "you saw yesterday"
-SingPastTransVerb and SingPresTransVerb (the singular past/present verbs
that are action verbs with direct objects) ie "I pay him twenty dollars"
where "pay" is the sing. pres transive verb or "I paid him twenty dollar"
for the past tense

I added production rules, show below:
-singularnoun-phrase (so that there would be a way to have an entire phrase
to represent a noun where all of it agrees) ie "The big dog" or "A man" all
have adjectives and articles that agree with the singular noun
-pluralnoun-phrase (same idea as above except plural) ie "Several dogs"
because we choose the plural forms of words to make noun phrases
-pluralverb-phrase (so that when making a plural sentence the verb agrees
with the rest) ie saying "The dogs run fast" instead of "The dogs runs fast"
-singularverb-phrase (same idea as above except singular) ie "I must seek a
job" where the singular verb phrase is "must seek a job"
-pluraladj-phrase (in order to have adjective phrases that can be used in a
a plural verb phrase for example but that will have correct agreement) ie
"They should be able to go" where the plural adj phrase is "able to go" in
order to describe what they should be
-plurprep-phrase (in order to have a prepositional phrase for plurals) ie
"He went to several stores" where the prep phrase is "to several stores"
-relplur-clause (in order to have relative clauses that can use a relative
pronoun) ie "I like the paintings that hang there" where the plural relative clause
is "that hang there"

Part 3:
*PLEASE NOTE THAT I USED TWO FUNCTIONS FROM THE BOOK THAT WERE NOT
ORIGINALLY IN THE GRAMMAR.LISP BUT THAT NORVIG HAD SO I ASSUMED IT WAS OK.
THESE METHODS ARE generate-all AND combine-all

*Also because I used the t.a.'s function to write to a file, I only produce
1 file, that I labeled as q2_gyg2104.txt

-my generateValid will generate a valid sentence
-the t.a. provided code does the combining with +/- of the sentences into
one file
-My additional two criteria are first to reject any sentence where there are
two articles next to each other, for example "The the dog ran", and then to
reject any sentence where there are too many coordinating conjunctions (no more than
three coordinating conjunctions allowed)
-I reject sentences that are too long, and set the "max length" to 30
-I reject words where the same word appears twice except for if it is an
article, conjunction (any type), preposition, or auxillary verb as these are
things that can be used multiple times in a sentence
-Although I understood in theory how to do the max depth tree thing, I
couldn't figure out how to implement it so I didn't do that part
